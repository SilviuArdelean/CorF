Q1 - How many namedops are in the file?
There are 11 'namedoperation'
---------------------------------------------------------------
Q2 - Which namedop identified by itÆs 'name' attribute is the most complex ?
 Which one is the least complex ?
The most complex 'namedop' is 'initSession' (count 7)
The less complex 'namedop' is 'initUserInfo' (count 1)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Q3 - Which namedop has a return value ?
The 'namedoperation' with 'returnedvalue' are:
        initDocument
        saveDocument
        getTableViewerData
        performTableViewerInput
        getDatabagViewerData
        performDatabagViewerInput
---------------------------------------------------------------
Q4 - Which is the maximum call depth for each namedop?
