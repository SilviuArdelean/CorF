 Which one is the least complex ?
The most complex (count 7) namedop is 'initSession'
The less complex (count 1) namedop is 'initUserInfo'
The less complex (count 1) namedop is 'saveDocument'
The less complex (count 1) namedop is 'postLoginWebInterface'
The less complex (count 1) namedop is 'stopWebInterface'
---------------------------------------------------------------
